# Userstyles

Userstyles for sites I have made throughout the years.

Hosting them here as the userstyles webpage seems to be having lots of trouble.

#### Current Styles:
* IMDb Nightmode
* Rottentomatoes Nightmode
* SoundCloud Nightmode

## Installation

Install [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) for your browser. 

Open the Stylus addon, click write new style and then under Mozilla Format choose import and paste the entire content of your chosen css-file and click overwrite style.

Save the style and it will automatically be applied.
